Introduction
============

Asynctest is a library which extends the standard pacakge :mod:`unittest` to
support asyncio features.

This tutorial aims at gathering examples showing how to use :mod:`asynctest`.
It is not a comprehensive documentation and doesn't explain the concepts of
:mod:`asyncio`.

Some basic patterns of :mod:`unittest` are covered. However, if you are not
familiar with :mod:`unittest`, it's probably a good idea to read its
documentation first.


.. note::

   This documentation has not yet been reviewed. The code samples and examples
   have been tested by the author but probably deserve (at least) a second
   look.

   This tutorial can be improved and probably contains mistakes, typos
   and incorrect sentences. It can be considered as an "early release". We
   invite you to open `issues or pull-requests on Github
   <https://github.com/Martiusweb/asynctest/>`_.
